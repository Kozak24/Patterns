# Adapter pattern

Adapter pattern example provides solution for XML to JSON conversion for further conversion, for example into dataclass objects.

P.S. The parses is not universal and has its own constraints, implementation has only demonstration/training purpose.

To run example, you simply need to run:

> [adapter_main.py](adapter/adapter_main.py)

# Bridge pattern

Bridge pattern example provides solution for RPG game with multiple races (Humans, Orcs, Elves, Gnomes, etc..) and multiple archetypes (Long Range, Mid-Range, Close Range). Usage of bridge pattern simplifies introduction of new archetypes as well as new races.

To run example, you simply need to run:

> [bridge_main.py](bridge/bridge_main.py)

# Decorator pattern

Decorator pattern example provides primitive solution for logging and time measurement by wrapping object.

To run example, you simply need to run:

> [decorator_main.py](decorator/decorator_main.py)

# Composite pattern

Composite pattern example provides solution for counting online order price in modern supermarket. Each order consists of packets, which consist of products and might contain packets too.

To run example, you simply need to run:

> [composite_main.py](composite/composite_main.py)

# Facade pattern

Facade pattern example provides solution for text comparing ratio by using high-level API which hides from user low-level Cosine Similarity algorithm and Text Filter which removes redundant text by regex.

To run example, you simply need to run:

> [facade_main.py](facade/facade_main.py)

# Flyweight pattern

Flyweight pattern example provides solution for storing shared data instead of creating it multiple times, in this example Color instance is stored as intrinsic value and created only once for each particular color.

To run example, you simply need to run:

> [flyweight_main.py](flyweight/flyweight_main.py)
