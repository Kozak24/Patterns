# Patterns

This repository contains self-studying implementations of GoF patterns, all the examples are created for demonstration purposes only and can't be used as ready products. The main idea is just to save it for the creator, and I hope that someone will find them useful just to practice or to find implementation.

You can find each group of patterns by the appropriate links

To run these examples you should use:

> python >= 3.8

[Behavioral Patterns](behavioral), please refer to the readme for more details: [ReadMe](behavioral/ReadMe.md)

If you are looking for study resource, I will recommend you to use [Refactoring Guru](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns). You can find there materials from A to Z. Each Pattern page has description, problem statement, solution, structure, pros and cons, code example in different languages, etc.
