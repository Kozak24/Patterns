Prototype pattern example provides solution for fighting game with soldier armies. It's enough to create soldier prototype and then all new soldier can be cloned just by using `clone` method from soldier prototype instance. Let's Clone Wars begin!

P.S. In real game implementation you can combine Abstract Factory to get Red/Blue soldier prototypes and Prototype pattern to actually create prototypes.

To run example, you simply need to run:

> [prototype_main.py](prototype/prototype_main.py)

# Singleton pattern
